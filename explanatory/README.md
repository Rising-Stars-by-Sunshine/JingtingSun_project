# Part II — Machine Learning for Explanation  
*Mapping the literature on women/“她” and Republican-era China*

> This folder documents the **explanatory ML** pipeline that structures existing scholarship (OpenAlex) and motivates variables/hypotheses for the newspaper-headline study in **Part I**.

---

##  What this does
- Build **multilingual sentence embeddings** for titles/abstracts and **cluster** them.  
- Render a **2-D topic map** and a **pruned semantic kNN network** (communities + **bridging works**).  
- Summarize **publication trends** and **OpenAlex concepts**.  
- Compute **preliminary sentiment by cluster** on a subset (*hypothesis-generating only*).  
- Export **processed tables** for reproducibility (cluster labels/shares, concepts, years, sentiment).

> These figures/tables are **descriptive scaffolding** for Part I — they are **not** direct evidence about newspapers.
